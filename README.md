## Ideas

Food theming and inspiration accross UI and app (make it funny)

1. Post recipes and share with friends
2. User groups for recipes
3. Add photos?
4. Paid tiers - Free, Basic, Premium, Commercial etc (replace with fun food names)
5. Top level ingredients card / ui design (prevent having to scroll forever to see)
6. Quick conversion tool to show measurements in different units ie: metric -> imperial
7. Drag and drop ingredients orders
8. Parse ingredients from URLs.
9. Allow ingredients to be reordered / recipes to be placed in different cookbooks (not sure if we need these ordered alphabetical is probs fine)
